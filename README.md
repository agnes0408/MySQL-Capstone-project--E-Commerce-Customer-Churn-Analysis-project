💼 Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses often struggle to retain customers due to evolving preferences and market competition.
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn drivers — such as tenure, satisfaction scores, payment modes, and purchase patterns — to help businesses proactively reduce churn and improve customer engagement.

🧹 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
🔸 Handling Missing Values & Outliers

Imputed mean values for:
WarehouseToHome, HourSpendOnApp, OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear, DaySinceLastOrder.

Imputed mode values for:
Tenure, CouponUsed, OrderCount.

Removed outliers in WarehouseToHome where values exceeded 100 km.

🔸 Dealing with Inconsistencies

Replaced:

“Phone” → “Mobile Phone” (PreferredLoginDevice)

“Mobile” → “Mobile Phone” (PreferedOrderCat)

Standardized payment modes:

“COD” → “Cash on Delivery”

“CC” → “Credit Card”

🔄 2️⃣ Data Transformation

Renamed Columns:

PreferedOrderCat → PreferredOrderCat

HourSpendOnApp → HoursSpentOnApp

Created New Columns:

ComplaintReceived = “Yes” if Complain = 1, else “No”.

ChurnStatus = “Churned” if Churn = 1, else “Active”.

Dropped Columns:

Removed Churn and Complain after transformation.

CREATE TABLE customer_returns (

);
